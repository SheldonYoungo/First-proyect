# First-proyect
This was my first proyect made in the Introduction to Web Development course made by Raspberry Pi Foundation as the last homework of the course. The code recopile all the topics that i'd learned from the course

The web site is about the main components of a computer. It has a quiz for those people who wants to prove their knowledge.

You just have to open the index.html file to see the main page.

I hope you like it!!

Pd: if you notice a bug, responsive problems, or whatever you think it can be improved please feel free to leave a comment :)
