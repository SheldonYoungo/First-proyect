# First-proyect
This was my first proyect made in the Introduction to Web Development course made by Raspberry Pi Foundation as the last homework of the course. The code recopile all the topics that i'd learned from the course.

The web site is about the main components of a computer. It has a quiz for those people who wants to prove their knowledge.
